## Questions

1. Re-write the following code by using the arrow function syntax:

   ```js
   function addToCart(item) {
     cart.add(item);
   }
   ```

   ```js
   // Please write your answer here
  const addToCart = () => {
     cart.add(item);
   }
   ```

2. Consider the functions `renderGuest`, `getGuestsWithChildTicket` and `getGuestsWithChildTicket` functions. Which array iteration methods would you use instead of the for loops?

  ```js
  const guests = [
    "Paul",
    "Fatima",
    "Anna",
    "Silver",
  ]

  const renderGuest = (guests) => {
    const guestList = document.querySelector('guests')
  
    for(let i = 0; i < guests.length; i++) {
      const guest = guests[i]
      guestList.innerHTML += `<p>${guest}</p>`
    }
  }

  const removeGuest = (guests, name) => {
    const updatedGuestList = []

    for(let i = 0; i < guests.length; i++) {
      const guest = guests[i]
      
      if (guest != name) {
        updatedGuestList.push(guest)
      }
    }
    
    return updatedGuestList
  }

  const checkInAllGuests = (guests) => {
    const checkedInGuests = []

    for(let i = 0; i < guests.length; i++) {
      guest = guests[i]
      checkedInGuests.push(`${guest} - Has checked in`)
    }

    return checkedInGuests
  }
  ```

  ```js
   // .forEach
  ```  

2. Write js code to destructure this object:

```js
const person = {
  name: "John",
  age: 21,
  gender: "m",
};

// Add your code here to destructure the object 'person'.
const {name, age, gender} = person;
```


3. Edit the code below to use enhanced object literal approach to assign properties.

```js
  const name = "Mary"
  const age = 22
  const gender = "f"


// Edit this object
const mary = {
  name, age, gender
};
```

4. Use the spread oprator to make a copy of fruits array and save it into a variable called 
fruitsCopy

```js

const fruits = ["dragon fruit", "kiwi", "mango"]
const fruitsCopy = [...fruits];

```
